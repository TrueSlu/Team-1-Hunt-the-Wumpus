## Git/Installation Instructions

1. Open up a `Command Prompt` window.
1. The bottom line is which folder in your computer you're currently in. Feel free to use the change directory command (`cd`) to navigate your computer's folders.
1. When you're in a suitable folder, clone this repository (creates a new project/repository folder in your current directory/folder): `git clone https://github.com/TrueSlu/Team-1-Hunt-the-Wumpus.git`
1. It might prompt your for authentication. Just type in your username and password and continue. If it asks for a "git identity", feel free to Google for a solution or follow the given directions.
1. The project is now cloned. Feel free to access to project and make changes.
1. When you're ready to "push" some changes, make sure to do the following:
1. Pull recent changes. If you didn't edit other people's stuff, there should be no merge conflicts. Use `git pull origin master` in your local repository folder in `Command Prompt`.
1. Test your code (make sure it works with the rest of the classes).
1. Add changes to your new commit: `git add .` (the . means "current directory").
1. Wrap those changes in a "commit": `git commit -m "your commit message here (i.e. added high score feature)"`. "-m" means "message". The following quote is your commit message and will be viewable to others.
1. Push your commit: `git push origin master`
1. Should be done! If you want, check the Github repo to make sure it's up... if some errors come up in any of these steps, reach out.
